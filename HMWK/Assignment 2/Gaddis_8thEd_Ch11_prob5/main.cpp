/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Dr. Mark E. Lehr
 * Created on July 19, 2016, 9:07 AM
 * Purpose:  The program should have an array of 12 structures 
 * to hold weather data for an entire year. When the program runs,
 *  it should ask the user to enter data for each month. 
 * (The average temperature should be calculated.) Once the data 
 * are entered for all the months, the program should calculate 
 * and display the average monthly rainfall, the total rainfall 
 * for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the year 
 * (and the months they occurred in), and the average of all the 
 * monthly average temperatures.
Input Validation: Only accept temperatures within the range 
 * between â€“100 and +140 degrees Fahrenheit.
